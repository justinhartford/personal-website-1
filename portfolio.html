                <h2>I put the user first, always</h2>
                <p class="description">Everything starts with: Is this actually helpful? I avoid dark patterns and extractive tactics. Trust compounds, tricks decay.</p>
                <div class="example">
                    <strong>At CFI:</strong> Rebuilt lead qualification to focus on fit over volume. MQL/Opp rate jumped 25%→45%, unqualified leads dropped 20%→5%.

                <h2>I favor systems over spikes</h2>
                <p class="description">I build loops and flywheels, not one-off wins. Sustainable growth beats temporary spikes.</p>
                <div class="example">
                    <strong>At Spring Health:</strong> Built ABM engine that drove 53% engagement uplift and $3.1M pipeline—designed to compound quarter over quarter.

                <h2>I'm data-informed, not data-paralyzed</h2>
                <p class="description">I run experiments and track results, but also trust judgment and experience. When conviction is high, I move.</p>
                <div class="example">
                    <strong>At Amperity:</strong> Doubled MQLs and revenue opportunities through paid search while cutting budget in half.

            <h2>Complete Philosophy</h2>
            <p><strong>Core Principles:</strong> I put users first. I invest in communities, not funnels. I make things I'd personally consume. I favor compounding systems. I choose long-term impact over short-term optics. I treat brand and trust as real assets. I use paid channels to learn. I value impact over activity. I'm data-informed, not paralyzed. I never forget distribution.</p>
            
            <p><strong>How I Collaborate:</strong> I work iteratively, share early and publicly (internally), optimize for clarity over cleverness, avoid silos, bias toward action, and seek direct contact with users and reality.</p>
            
            <p><strong>What You Can Expect:</strong> Thoughtful work over performative work. Clear communication and visible progress. Respect for users, teammates, and craft. A willingness to experiment, learn, and adapt. A preference for building things that last.</p>
