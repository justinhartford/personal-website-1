                <h3>My Core Principles</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>I put the user first, always.</strong> Everything starts with: Is this actually helpful? I avoid dark patterns and extractive tactics. Trust compounds, tricks decay.</li>
                    <li><strong>I invest in communities, not funnels.</strong> Strong communities are built by being useful, generous, and human. I contribute before I convert.</li>
                    <li><strong>I make things I'd personally consume.</strong> If I wouldn't read it, click it, or find it valuable, I don't want my name on it.</li>
                    <li><strong>I favor compounding systems over one-off wins.</strong> I build loops and flywheels, not spikes that disappear.</li>
                    <li><strong>I choose long-term impact over short-term optics.</strong> I'm willing to delay gratification for lasting value.</li>
                    <li><strong>I treat brand and trust as real assets.</strong> Every interaction leaves a residue. Consistency and integrity matter.</li>
                    <li><strong>I use paid channels to learn, not to posture.</strong> Fast channels are laboratories that teach me about messaging and audiences.</li>
                    <li><strong>I value impact over activity.</strong> Motion is not progress. I focus on work that meaningfully moves things forward.</li>
                    <li><strong>I'm data-informed, not data-paralyzed.</strong> I love good data, but also trust judgment and experience. When conviction is high, I move.</li>
                    <li><strong>I never forget distribution.</strong> Creation without distribution is half-finished. Getting it in front of the right people is part of the craft.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>How I Collaborate</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>I work iteratively.</strong> Small, shippable increments over long build cycles. I want feedback early to adjust before cost accumulates.</li>
                    <li><strong>I share early and in public (internally).</strong> I default to transparency. I share drafts and half-formed ideas so others can shape them with me.</li>
                    <li><strong>I optimize for clarity over cleverness.</strong> If something is hard to understand, I assume it's my responsibility to make it clearer.</li>
                    <li><strong>I avoid silos.</strong> I loop people in early, especially those downstream. Surprises are fun at parties, not in operations.</li>
                    <li><strong>I have a bias toward action.</strong> I'd rather test a reasonable idea than debate a perfect one indefinitely.</li>
                    <li><strong>I seek direct contact with users and reality.</strong> Dashboards are useful, but conversations are irreplaceable.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>What You Can Expect From Me</h4>
                <ul class="expectations">
                    <li>Thoughtful work over performative work</li>
                    <li>Clear communication and visible progress</li>
                    <li>Respect for users, teammates, and craft</li>
                    <li>Willingness to experiment, learn, and adapt</li>
                    <li>Preference for building things that last</li>
                </ul>
